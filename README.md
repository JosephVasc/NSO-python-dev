# NSO-python-dev
some basic commands using python's requests library to maniuplate NSO machine
This is a CLI created with python requests to retrieve and manipulate data provided from a cisco devbox

              " 'get devices'        returns all devices on NSO \n"
              " 'get device'         returns hostname of device \n"
              " 'get loop'           returns Loopback services \n"
              " 'patch loop'         patches a new Loopback service \n"
              " 'delete loop'        deletes existing Loopback service\n"
              " 'patch loop all'     patches a new Loopback service for all devices \n"
              " 'device config'      returns config of specified device ")


area's of improvement / things I did not get to:
- adding more commands, reaching vlan info etc.

Overall this was a fun project and I enjoy learning more about NSO
