# NSO-python-dev
some basic commands using python's requests library to maniuplate NSO machine

area's of improvement / things I did not get to:
- I would like to add some string formatting to specify the loopback service name, along with user specified device list to apply the service to. Also to be handle deleting specific names, currently you can do this but need to edit the actual path in the api call. 
- Some tweaks to UI to make it seem a bit cleaner
- specifying the url and port in a variable and referencing it once throughout the code to make sure im following SOLID design principals 
- adding more commands, reaching vlan info etc.

Overall this was a fun project and I enjoy learning more about NSO
