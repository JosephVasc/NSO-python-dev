# NSO-python-dev
some basic commands using python's requests library to maniuplate NSO machine

area's of improvement / things I did not get to:
- I would like to add some string formatting to specify the loopback service name, along with user specified device list to apply the service too. 
- Some tweaks to UI to make it seem a bit cleaner
- specifying the url and port in a variable and referencing it once throughout the code to make sure im following SOLID design principals 
- adding more commands, reaching vlan info etc.

Overall this was a fun project and I enjoy learning more about NSO
